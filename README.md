Welcome to the front-end repository of my Marvel tribute!

As a big Marvel enthusiast, I had a lot of fun creating this Marvel themed full-stack application! The back end communicates with an API containing data on more than 47,000 characters and comic books from the Marvel universe, and users can create an account and add comic books as well as characters to their list of favorites. Here are the pages available on the website:
- /comics
- /characters
- /comics:id
- /favorites
- /signup
- /login
User needs to be authenticated in order to access the "/favorites" page.
